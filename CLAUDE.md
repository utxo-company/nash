# Claude Code Guidelines for Nash Compiler

## Project Overview

Nash is a programming language compiler being ported from the Elm compiler. We are translating Haskell to Rust while adapting to Rust idioms where appropriate.

## Reference Material

The Elm compiler source is cloned locally at `elm/` (gitignored). Use this as the primary reference for:
- Parser structure: `elm/compiler/src/Parse/`
- Error types: `elm/compiler/src/Reporting/Error/Syntax.hs`
- AST definitions: `elm/compiler/src/AST/`

## Memory Management

We use **bumpalo** for arena allocation:
- One `Bump` arena per module
- All AST nodes are allocated in the arena
- Source text is loaded into the arena first, so `&'a str` slices point into arena memory
- Unified `'a` lifetime throughout - drop the arena, everything is freed
- bumpalo does NOT call `Drop` on items - this is fine since we only store `Copy` types or references

```rust
let bump = Bump::new();
let src: &str = bump.alloc_str(&file_contents);
let mut parser = Parser::new(&bump, src.as_bytes());
```

### AST Type Guidelines

**Inline small `Copy` types** - don't put them behind `&'a`:
- Small enums (e.g., `VarType`, `Associativity`) - just store the value
- Newtypes around primitives (e.g., `Precedence(u16)`) - just store the value
- `Region` (8 bytes of integers) - same size as a pointer, no benefit to indirection

**Use `&'a T` for**:
- Large types
- Recursive types (must break infinite size)
- Slices (`&'a [T]`, `&'a str`)

**Use `Option<&'a T>` not `&'a Option<T>`**:
- Null pointer optimization makes `Option<&'a T>` the same size as `&'a T`
- `None` is free (null pointer, no arena allocation)
- Only allocates when `Some`

## Testing Strategy

We use **insta** for snapshot testing with extremely granular tests:
- Separate macros for success vs error cases
- `assert_X_snapshot!` - expects Ok, panics on Err, snapshots the parsed value
- `assert_X_error_snapshot!` - expects Err, panics on Ok, snapshots the error

Macros are defined in each module's test submodule for proper namespacing.

Example snapshot output:
```
---
source: crates/nash-parse/src/lib.rs
description: "42"
---
42
```

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo insta test
cargo insta accept  # to accept new snapshots
cargo insta test --unreferenced delete  # delete stale snapshots
```

### Test String Formatting

The test macros use `indoc!` which strips leading indentation, so:
- **Simple one-liners** stay simple: `assert_expression_snapshot!("if x then y else z");`
- **Multiline tests** use the `assert_indented_*_snapshot!` macro variants,
  which lay the fragment out as it would appear indented inside a
  definition (a token at column 1 always starts a new top-level
  declaration, so bare multiline fragments are not valid input):
  ```rust
  assert_indented_expression_snapshot!(r#"
      if condition then
          trueBranch
      else
          falseBranch
  "#);
  ```
- No need to slam strings to the left - `indoc` handles it
- Only use multiline raw strings when testing actual multiline syntax

## Progress Tracking

**SPEC.md** at the repo root tracks:
- Implementation progress with checkboxes
- Grammar definitions in EBNF notation

Update SPEC.md as features are implemented.

## Development Workflow

1. Add grammar rule to SPEC.md
2. Write snapshot test(s) first
3. Implement parser code
4. Run `cargo insta test`, review snapshots
5. Mark complete in SPEC.md

## Validation

After making changes, run these checks before committing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all          # format code
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  # lint (warnings = errors)
cargo test               # run tests
```

These same checks run in CI on every push/PR.

## Error Messages

We are porting Elm's full error hierarchy from `Reporting/Error/Syntax.hs`. Error types are nested (Module contains Decl, Decl contains Expr, etc.) to enable Elm-quality error messages.

## Versioning & Changesets

We use [**sampo**](https://github.com/bruits/sampo/blob/main/crates/sampo/README.md) for changelog and version management:
- Each crate has its own independent version (no shared `version.workspace = true`)
- When making notable changes, create a changeset with `sampo add`
- Sampo handles granular per-crate version bumps based on what actually changed
- CI runs the Sampo GitHub Action to automate release PRs and publishing

```bash
# single crate
sampo add -p nash-parse -m "Add support for let expressions"

# multiple crates in one changeset
sampo add -p nash-parse -p nash-region -m "Add position tracking to let expressions"
```

Since `sampo add` requires interactive bump level selection, Claude should write changeset files directly to `.sampo/changesets/` instead:

```markdown
---
cargo/nash-parse: minor
cargo/nash-region: patch
---

Add position tracking to let expressions.
```

Use a short descriptive filename like `.sampo/changesets/let-expr-positions.md`.

## Code Style

- Recursive descent parser (not parser combinators)
- Single `Parser<'a>` struct combining arena + state
- Incremental implementation - test each feature before moving on
- No premature abstraction
